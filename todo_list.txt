Make cats that meow on the same beat do something more interesting than just doubling the volume
Also, don't make them double the volume

Reorganize code so that its more readable
Figure out the best system for doing that, actually

probably just rewrite the entirety of the cat/big cat script :(

make a set of global audio players that only play a certain amount of notes at a time
