1:
	Make cats that meow on the same beat do something more interesting than just doubling the volume
	Also, don't make them double the volume
2:
	Reorganize code so that its more readable
	Figure out the best system for doing that, actually
3:
	probably just rewrite the entirety of the cat/big cat script :(
